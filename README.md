# CopypastaManager

Copypasta Manager is a Windows form GUI that allows you to store your favorite copypastas and copy right from the application. 

Started in Dec. 2023, this project is currently ongoing, and this is a screenshot of what the the functioning app will look like. Updated whenever I have time. 

This project was made because I've noticed that in Twitch Chats, people spam copypastas that are unique to their favorite streamer's community. A Copypasta application wasn't something that was commonly spoken about so this project had some use that it could serve, for me at least.
